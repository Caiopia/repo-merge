## Notes

- Using `git subtree` like this is really simple.
- Git history is sort of preserved, but only in the root directory. Reverts or blames won't work well because of this.
- We aren't able to view history of individual files using `git log --follow <file path>` nor in GitHub.
- Does have the ability to pull from each repo to make it easy to iterate on changes.

See other branches for different approaches.
